"""Shared recurrence kernel: candidate slots → exclusion → override → final.

This module is the single recurrence computation chain behind both
recurrence endpoints:

* :mod:`app.expander` (/expand) projects the surviving *instances*;
* :mod:`app.provenance` (/provenance) projects the per-occurrence
  *provenance chain* (generation, exclusion, override, final state).

Both are projections of :func:`compute_candidates`, so the two endpoints
cannot drift apart: one ICS expanded through either endpoint is judged by
the same candidate set, the same EXDATE handling, the same RECURRENCE-ID
override application, the same timezone windowing and the same per-UID
safety cap.

The kernel pipeline for one UID group (master + RECURRENCE-ID overrides):

1. **candidate slots** — DTSTART/RRULE/RDATE generate scheduled slots
   inside the query window padded backwards by the event duration (so
   events starting before the window but overlapping it still appear);
2. **exclusion** — EXDATE marks the slots it removes (excluded slots stay
   visible as candidates so their exclusion can be reported);
3. **override** — a RECURRENCE-ID component replaces its slot: reschedules
   it, modifies it in place, or cancels it (STATUS:CANCELLED); an override
   naming a slot the series never generates becomes an orphan candidate;
4. **final instances** — each candidate carries its effective
   DTSTART/DTEND/STATUS plus the materialized :class:`Instance` when it
   survives.

Timezones are interpreted as IANA names via zoneinfo, so DST transitions
are honored automatically. Everything is normalized to UTC.
